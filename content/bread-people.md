# The bread people
 a website designed for selling bread. Here's a glimpse of the technologies and features I utilized:

- **Next.js:** Leveraging the power of server-side rendering for lightning-fast web experiences.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Creating sleek and responsive designs with ease, ensuring a delightful user interface.

- **AOS (Animate on Scroll):** Adding an extra layer of interactivity and engagement to my web creations.

- **Admin Page with SQLite3 Database:** I've built an admin interface for easy content management powered by an SQLite3 database, making it simple to keep your website up-to-date and track orders.

- **Custom Fully Secured API Endpoints:** Security is a top priority for me. I've implemented custom API endpoints with robust security measures to protect your data and ensure a seamless experience for users.
